🌍🏏 Building a Dream XI with Data Insights! 🌏🏏
I’ve taken my passion for cricket and combined it with my data analysis skills to create a Power BI dashboard that helped me select a diverse and well-balanced Dream XI. Here's how I structured the team and leveraged the dashboard for insights:
**Dashboard Highlights:**
## Player Performance Metrics:
**Batting Stats:** Average, strike rate, centuries, and consistency in different match formats.
****Bowling Stats:**** Economy rate, strike rate, and wicket-taking ability across conditions.**
Fielding Impact:** Catches, run-outs, and overall contribution in the field.
## Country-Wise Diversity:
Visualized player distribution from different nations to ensure a truly global Dream XI.
**Match Scenarios:**
Analyzed player performances under pressure situations, like chasing or defending totals.
**Role-Based Filters:**
Segmented players into categories like openers, anchors, all-rounders, finishers, and bowlers for targeted selection.
**Form and Fitness Trends:**
Used recent performance data to pick players who are in peak form.
**Team Structure:**
**Openers:** Players who excel in powerplay conditions and can dominate from the start.
**Anchors:** Reliable batsmen to guide the innings through tough patches.
**All-Rounders:** Versatile contributors who strengthen both batting and bowling departments.
**Finishers:** Explosive hitters to accelerate scoring in the death overs.
**Fast Bowlers:** Seamers who bring pace, swing, and accuracy to dismantle batting lineups.
This dashboard-based approach emphasizes how data-driven decisions can enhance team selection and strategy, reflecting the importance of analytics in modern sports. 🏏📊
